WooCommerce Cart issues
I am Cheryl Henry, comfortable with html, new to wordpress. Recently designed new store https://thesupersprockets.com. Having a problem with the cart page being condensed to the left. I have tried many things but I do not know how to fix. I don't know php but i do know how to edit php files. I believe I need to create a child template of Divi them but I do not know how yet.
